# 📜 *Othello: Interactive Manuscript*

### An Interactive Narrative Experience Inspired by Shakespeare’s *Othello*

A fully original **ENG4U Creative Task** reimagining Shakespeare’s *Othello* as a modern interactive manuscript blending story, emotional simulation, and character-perspective documents.

Built using **React**, **Vite**, and deployed via **Vercel**.

---

## ⭐ Overview

**Othello: Interactive Manuscript** is a story-driven, choice-based interactive web experience that explores the psychological unraveling of Othello through:

* A **branching narrative** based on user decisions
* A dynamic **emotional stat simulation** (Jealousy, Trust, Dependence)
* **Iago’s Deception Logs**
* **Desdemona’s Private Journals**
* A fictional **Social Feed** reflecting public perception

The project presents the tragedy through a **manuscript-style UI**, creating an immersive 1600s aesthetic while still allowing modern user interactivity.

This work fulfills the requirements of the **ENG4U Creative Shakespeare Task**, demonstrating creative reinterpretation, understanding of themes, and technical execution.

## 🎭 Features

### 🧠 **Branching Interactive Narrative**

* 20+ scenes (macro + micro choices)
* Multiple unique paths and outcomes
* Logical state-driven branching (flags + emotional scores)

### 💔 **Emotional Simulation System**

Your choices influence three emotional metrics:

| Stat           | Description                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Jealousy**   | Measures Othello’s rising suspicion and insecurity |
| **Trust**      | His belief in Desdemona, Cassio, and himself       |
| **Dependence** | His emotional reliance on Iago                     |

Final endings are determined by statistical thresholds + triggered narrative flags.
